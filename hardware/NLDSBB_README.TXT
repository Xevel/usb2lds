This board makes it easy to interface 


Versions

v2.0
Changes:
 - TODO


v1.1
Changes:
 - Q5 to NMOS (schematic & BOM change only)
Known bugs:
 - The ATTiny without external oscillator does not have a good enough clock for reliable 115200bps reading... (8MHz => -3.5% error, but the clock is calibrated at +/- 10%!)


v1.0 - first test PCB
Known bugs:
 - The ATTiny without external oscillator does not have a good enough clock for reliable 115200bps reading... (8MHz => -3.5% error, but the clock is calibrated at +/- 10%!)
 - Q5 should be NMOS (affects shematics & BOM only)

v0.1 - initial board
